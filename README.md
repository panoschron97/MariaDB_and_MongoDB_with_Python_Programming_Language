I developed a Python program that utilizes two databases to answer a variety of questions all organized through a user-friendly menu interface. The data is on the website: **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset**.

Questions i answered:

1. How many tips have four or more compliments?
2. What are the names of the companies that have four or more compliments?
3. For the above businesses (which have four or more compliments), what is the sum of all the compliments they have.
4. What is the name and coordinates of the businesses that have a "Happy Hour" service?
5. What are the names of the first 12 companies in checkin number?
6. How many users have reviewed with more than four stars?
7. How many stars do users give on average in their reviews?
8. How many stars on average have been given by users who have at least one vote on useful, funny or cool?
9. What are the names of the users who have given five stars and the review was this at least three times useful?

11. Display the name, friends and how long they have been on Yelp of those who have given a 5 star review, before 2013, in operations in America.
12. For those users who have more than 200 reviews, display the geographic location in which they are more active. More specifically, the first three locations based on latitude, longitude, without the decimal places. That is, if a user has reviewed a location (38.551126, -110.880452) and (38.999999, -110.000000), we consider that he has made two reviews on the site (38.000000, -110.000000), or more generally (38, -110).
13. What are the names of the businesses that are open?
14. What are the names of the companies that have more than 10 reviews?
